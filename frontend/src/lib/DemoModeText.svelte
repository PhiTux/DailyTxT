You are using the <strong>demo mode</strong> of
<a href="https://github.com/PhiTux/DailyTxT" target="_blank">DailyTxT</a>.<br />
Data resets every 30 minutes (:00 and :30) - this includes all accounts and logs/files.<br /><br />

<strong><u>Create your own individual testing-account, login and have fun </u></strong>🚀<br /><br
/>

For testing-purposes, you even have access to the build-in admin console (inside the settings of
your personal account) by using the password: <code>admin</code>.<br />
Be nice to other test-user-accounts 🤝<br /><br />

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
	After the data is reset (see above) strange things might happen - just logout and recreate your
	account.
</div>
